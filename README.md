Project was built using Next.js (v13.1.2), a powerful React-based framework that provides server-rendering, static site generation, and efficient build-time optimizations. The website's UI components and design system were developed using a combination of Headless UI (v1.7.7), Next UI (v1.0.0-beta.12), and DaisyUI (v2.49.0), which offer highly customizable, accessible, and responsive components for building intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces.

For the CSS and styling, the project leveraged Tailwind CSS (v3.2.4), a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid styling with minimal effort. PostCSS (v8.4.21) and Autoprefixer (v10.4.13) were used as part of the development process, ensuring that the generated CSS is compatible with various browsers and devices.

To add rich motion and animations to the user interface, the project utilized the Framer Motion (v8.5.3) library, which is a powerful and flexible animation library for React.

For handling icons, React Icons (v4.7.1) was utilized, offering a vast collection of popular icon sets such as FontAwesome, Material Design, and more.

The project also employed Sharp (v0.31.3) to process images efficiently, optimizing performance and improving the user experience. With the use of the @next/font (v13.1.2) package, web fonts were optimized and served efficiently.

To maintain code quality and adherence to best practices, the project made use of ESLint (v8.32.0) and the ESLint configuration for Next.js (v13.1.2). This helped in identifying potential issues and keeping the codebase clean and consistent.
